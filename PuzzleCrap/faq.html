        <h1 id="sep">What even is PuzzleCrap?!</h1>
        
        <p>This is not a puzzle website, instead a testing ground for many types of HTML5 minigames and webpages alike. I have low skill when it comes to JavaScript, so this is where I come to practice.</p>
        
        <h1 id="sep">And why is it called PC?</h1>
        
        <p>I have not a clue.</p>
        
        <h1 id="sep">Will this work in my browser?</h1>
        
        <p>I don't know! I don't guarantee compatibility with your browser, and these were only tested on Chrome 81 / Firefox 75 / Opera 68.</p>
