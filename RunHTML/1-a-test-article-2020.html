            <p>I will admit that I have no idea what I'm doing. Still gonna try and do this stuff here though, so here we go!! :p<br><br>This is still definitely a test and I probably won't share this absolutely anywhere, but I'm gonna do this because I need the practice. I've always loved programming in a browser, and I've gained a massive respect for JS, CSS3 (kinda), and HTML5!!<br><br>But yeah, very short little thing I've typed here, just wanted to make a test for typed talking through radio-waves lol. Bai. You're cool.</p>
